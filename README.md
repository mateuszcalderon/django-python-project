  <h1>Django and Python Project</h1>
</div>

## Resources:
To learn about Django and its role, I followed the tutorials from the YouTube channel **Webdesign em Foco**. You can check out his first Python tutorial video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcjBIt6rwTY)!

## Installation:
### 1. Install Python
If you don't have Python installed on your system, download it from the official website:
- [Python Official Website](https://www.python.org/)

You can check if Python is installed and verify its version by running ` python --version ` on your Command Prompt/Terminal.

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment
It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to keep your project dependencies isolated and avoid conflicts with other Python projects.<br/>
To create a virtual environment:
  a. Navigate to the directory where you want to set up your Django project. You can use your Command Prompt/Terminal.
  b. Then, run the following command to create your virtual environment:
` python -m venv venv `

## Development Environment:
This project was developed using the following tools and versions:
  - Django: 5.1.2
  - mysqlclient: 2.2.4
  - PyCharm: 2024.2.1 (Community Edition)
  - Python: 3.12.6
  - WampServer: 3.3.5 

## Project Disclaimer:
**Note:** The primary goal of this project was to develop and enhance my skills in Django and Python. While the application includes  CSS and HTML, these are not the main focus of the project, and the Front End code may not adhere to the best practices or modern standards.<br/>
Please consider this project as a learning exercise for Back End development with Python and Django.
